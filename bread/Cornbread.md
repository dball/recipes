# Cornbread

Based on my father's recipe. Serves 8.

Southern-style cornbread is a less moist, more crumbly bread, perfect for eating alongside soups or saucy barbecue dishes.

## Equipment

* Two mixing bowls
* Two round 9" baking pans

## Ingredients

* 1.5 cups yellow cornmeal
* 0.5 cups cane sugar
* 1 Tbsp salt
* 4 tsp baking powder
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1.25 cups whole milk
* 0.25 cups cooking, vegetable, or corn oil
* 2 large eggs

## Preparation

* Preheat oven to 425ºF
* Mix dry ingredients thoroughly in a mixing bowl
* In a separate bowl, beat eggs, then combine with oil and milk
* Add wet mix slowly to dry ingredients while mixing; mix until smooth
* Pour batter into well-greased 9" baking pans (warning: batter will expand 2-3x in height while cooking)
* Bake for 20-25 minutes at 425ºF (until a fork comes out cleanly)
* Remove from the pan, slice, and serve
