# Cold Brew Coffee

Cold-brewed coffee has a smoother, less acidic flavor, and is tasty on a hot summer day.

## Ingredients

* ~1 gallon (~4L) jug or container with lid
* ~1 gallon (~4L) room-temperature water (e.g. tap water)
* 12oz (340g) coarse-ground, medium-roast coffee

## Preparation

* Put the coffee grounds into the jug (rolled up wax or parchment paper can act as a funnel to make this easier)
* Fill the jug almost full with the water
* Put on the lid, shake vigorously, top up the water
* Put the jug of coffee in your fridge
* Wait 12 hours, occasionally shaking it back up
* Strain through a mesh strainer and then coffee filters to remove the coffee grounds

## Serve

Enjoy on ice, mixed with milk, or however you like your iced coffee.
