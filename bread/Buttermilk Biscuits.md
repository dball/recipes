# Buttermilk Biscuits

Buttermilk biscuits should be wonderfully fluffy, with just a very subtle buttery flavor. Good biscuits can be enjoyed on their own, or with butter, jam, egg & cheese, sausage gravy, or many other toppings.

* Prep time: 15 min
* Cook time: 15 min
* Yield: 12 biscuits

## Ingredients

* 2 cups all purpose flour, sifted
* 4 tsp baking _powder_
* 1/4 tsp baking _soda_
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 2 Tbsp butter (cold)
* 2 Tbsp shortening (cold)
* 1 cup buttermilk (cold)

For the shortening, you can use clarified bacon grease, or a vegetable-based shortening like Crisco.

For this recipe, it is important to keep the butter, shortening, and milk refrigerated right until you need them.

## Preparation

* Preheat oven to 450ºF
* Combine dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl
* Cut the butter and shortening into small bits (about 5-10mm on a side), distributed evenly over the top of the dry ingredients. Using your fingertips and working quickly, mash the butter and shortening into the dry ingredients until it looks like crumbs. Keep plenty of flour on the fats so they don’t stick to your fingers. An alternative is to use a food processor in very short pulses. Either way, you must be quick because you don’t want the fats to melt into the flour. Your goal is a lot of little particles of butter and shortening distributed throughout.
* In the bowl, make a well in the middle of the mixture and pour in the cold buttermilk. Stir it just until the dough comes together, and no more. The dough should be sticky but very fluffy.
* Turn the dough out onto a floured cutting board. Lightly dust the dough with flour and then fold it upon itself 4-6 times. Don't smash it down – you want it to say really fluffy.
* Gently press the dough down until it is 2 or 3 centimeters (1 inch) thick. Cut out biscuits with a 5cm (2-inch) cutter, doing your best to cut the biscuits close together. Push straight down into the dough, twisting the cutter. Once you get to the bottom wiggle the cutter a little, and the lift to extract the biscuit. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet with 5-10mm of separation between them. Re-form scrap dough to cut more biscuits; be careful to work the dough as little as possible to keep it nice and fluffy.
* Bake at 450ºF for 12-16 minutes. The biscuits should puff up. While they’re cooking, melt 1 tbsp butter in the microwave.
* When the biscuits are just starting to get a very light brown on top (~8-10 minutes in), pull them out, brush a little butter on top of the biscuits, and stick them back in the oven. Cook for the remainder of the time – they’ll be golden brown on top. Don’t overcook them – a medium-light brown is all you want. See the photo above as a reference.

Spread a clean towel over a bowl or basket for holding the biscuits. As soon as the biscuits come out of the oven, put them in the bowl/towel, and wrap the towel across the top to keep the biscuits hot and delicious.
