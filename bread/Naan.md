# Naan

Easy-to-make Indian flatbread.  Based on [this recipe](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2010/09/naan/),
but scaled up to make 12 naan.

## Equipment

* Large mixing bowl
* Floured work surface for kneading

## Ingredients

* 15g yeast (1/2 oz, ~2 packets)
* 8g sugar (~1.5 tsp)
* 170g warm water (~3/4 cup)
* 90g olive oil (~3/8 cup)
* 120g plain full-fat yogurt (~1/2 cup)
* 1 large egg
* 200g bread flour (approx 1.5 cups), sifted
* 270g all-purpose flour (approx 2 cups)
* 4g salt (~1/2 tsp)

## Preparation

1. Combine yeast, sugar, and water; stir, set aside until foamy on top (~5 minutes)
2. Add oil, yogurt, and egg to yeast mixture and whisk until combined.
3. In separate mixing bowl, combine salt and bread flour.
4. Stir in the wet mixture, mixing until well combined.
5. Add all-purpose flour 70g (~1/2 cup) at a time, stirring in the new flour.  Stop when it is hard to stir
6. Turn out dough onto floured surface.  Dust with more flour and knead for ~5 minutes.  The dough should be soft and smooth but not sticky.  Don't add too much flour!
7. Cover dough loosely, let rise until doubled in size (~1 hour)
8. Divide the dough into three parts, and divide each part into four portions, for a total of 12.
9. Shape each of the 12 parts into a ball, and cover and let rise for another hour
10. Heat a large, heavy, lightly-oiled skillet over high heat.  Oil the pan with something that has a high smoke point.
11. Smoosh each dough ball into a ~6mm-thick (1/4") round.  Place into the skillet and cook until golden brown and bubbles form on top.  Flip over and cook until golden, then remove from heat.
12. Don't smoosh dough until right before cooking.  Keep finished naan warm in a low-heat oven or under a towel.
13. If you want to add garlic or herbs to the naan, push them into the uncooked top of the dough right after placing into the pan.
14. Brush with clarified butter and serve
