# Chai (Spiced Tea)

Enjoy it hot or chill it and serve iced on a hot day.  This will make a fairly
strong tea so taste it and cut with water or milk+honey to taste.

## Ingredients

* 1 gallon water
* 3 four-inch long cinnamon sticks, lightly crushed
* 1.5 tsp whole cloves, lightly cracked
* 2 Tbsp cardamom pods, crushed
* 1 cubic inch ginger, sliced thin
* 2 Tbsp Loose-leaf black tea
* 1 tsp Black peppercorns, lightly cracked

## Preparation

* Bring water to a simmer in a stockpot
* Put everything else into the water
* Simmer for 1 hour, covered
* Remove from heat, strain out the spices
* Replace cover and chill overnight in fridge
* Serve to taste (I like 1:1 ratio with milk, over ice)
